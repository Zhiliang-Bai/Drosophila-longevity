To investigate how lipid products from engineered yeasts influence gut physiology and lifespan, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on gut tissues from 45-day-old flies fed with lipid extracts from different yeast strains, or a control diet without lipid supplementation, strictly following the Fly Cell Atlas protocol. Paired brain tissues were also collected, given the critical role of the gut-brain axis in Drosophila aging.

Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System with a paired-end 150bp read length.
